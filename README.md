Selective Syllabus

### VMP991 â€œ Transboundary animal disease &amp; spatial epidemiology

### Course Description

This course provides an introduction to the epidemiology of transboundary animal diseases (TADs) and the application of spatial epidemiology. It will focus on animal diseases with epidemic potential which present high transmission rates and the potential capability of a very rapid spread, irrespective of national borders. Students will develop an understanding of the key concepts about TAD control and how and when to use spatial analysis for this purpose. Topics covered will include introduction to TADs spread and control, development, understanding and use of different types of spatial data, causal inference with spatial data, and specific examples of applications of spatial analysis to epidemiological problems including biogeography. The course will also provide initial training for undergraduate students in the use of disease mapping applied in surveillance and control of TADs and its extrapolation to other animal diseases including pets.

**Proposed typical term and frequency** (circumstances may dictate variances, but a typical expectation is helpful for planning)

Preferred Term(s): Spring Only

Preferred Week(s): Week 1 Only

Preferred Year: Offered Every Year

Minimum Enrollment: 5

Maximum Enrollment: 12

**Course Restrictions** :

Professional Year Restrictions: PY1 only

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, the students will be able to:

1. Define and differentiate transboundary diseases versus foreign animal diseases, as well as passive versus active surveillance.
2. Identify the different spatial data (i.e. raster, polygons and point dispersion), and how they are used to make informative decision in the public and private sector.
3. Be able to describe basic concepts of spatial and spatiotemporal epidemiology
  1. Value of spatial epidemiology; when and why to use its tools
  2. Types of spatial disease spread patterns
  3. Determinants and indicators of transboundary animal diseases
4. Use R to produce disease maps and apply basic spatial epidemiologic analyses to describe and control transboundary diseases.

### Grading, Grade Components and Requirements for Credit-Only (S/U) Grading

To receive a satisfactory (&quot;S&quot;) grade for this selective, students are expected to complete each of the following components:

| **Component** | **Weight** |
| --- | --- |
| Critical review of at least one published article | 50% |
| Group assignment- The development of a R-Markdown (annotated) file to be shared with all students | 50% |
| Total | 100% |

####

### Safety &amp; Risk Assumptions

The practice of Veterinary Medicine involves a number of risks: physical injury, exposure to infectious diseases, exposure to anesthetic agents, exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs, and exposure to radiation. You have received training in minimizing these risks, but should alert a clinician immediately if you feel you are in danger or if you are actually injured.

#### Policies on Incomplete Grades

If an extended deadline is not authorized, an unfinished incomplete grade will automatically change to an F after either (a) the end of the next regular semester in which the student is enrolled (not including summer sessions), or (b) by the end of 12 months if the student is not enrolled, whichever is shorter. Incompletes that change to F will count as an attempted course on transcripts. The burden of fulfilling an incomplete grade is the responsibility of the student. The university policy on incomplete grades is located at [http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-03](http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-03).

#### Late Assignments

Late assignments will not be accepted.

### Attendance Policy

For complete attendance and excused absence policies, please see [http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03](http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03) and [http://www.cvm.ncsu.edu/academicaffairs/Attendance.html](http://www.cvm.ncsu.edu/academicaffairs/Attendance.html)

#### Academic Integrity

Students are required to comply with the respective CVM and university policy on academic integrity found at [http://www.cvm.ncsu.edu/academicaffairs/conduct.html](http://www.cvm.ncsu.edu/academicaffairs/conduct.html) and
